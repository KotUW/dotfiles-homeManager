== Consideratios:

- WezTerm Flatpak doesn't work with symlinks. So manual.

== Directory Structure

- `home.nix` contains most of the configuration. should be Combatible with all other home-mangaer installations.
- `flake.nix` contains installation instructions for home-manager.
- `confile/*` For programs that don't have modules yet.
- `flake.lock` contains the exact version of home-manager installed in this computer. Could be updated using `nix flake update .`.
